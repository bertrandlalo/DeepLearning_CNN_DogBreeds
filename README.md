# deep_dog_breeds
As part of Udacity online course on Deep Learning, this notebook is my first 'hands-on' exercise to use convolutionnal neural networks to classify images.  I'm tackling the very classic problem of dog classification. The goal is to build a model capable of doing breed classification of a dog by just “looking” into its image.  If a dog is detected in the image, the app should provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If it's a human, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.
